//Stress TEST
/*
You typically want to stress test an API or website to determine:

-How your system will behave under extreme conditions.
-What the maximum capacity of your system is in terms of users or throughput.
-The breaking point of your system and its failure mode.
-If your system will recover without manual intervention after the stress test is over.

When stress testing, you configure the test to include more concurrent users or generate higher throughput than:

Your application typically sees.
You think your application can handle.
Note that a stress test doesn't overwhelm the system immediately â€” that's a spike test, which we'll cover soon.

A stress test should be configured in many gradual steps, each step increasing the concurrent load of the system.
